    Only retrieval queries are allowed.

    For things like industry, company names and other string fields, use the ILIKE operator and convert both the search term and the field to lowercase using LOWER() function. For example: LOWER(industry) ILIKE LOWER('%search_term%').

    Note: artists is a comma-separated list of artists. Trim whitespace to ensure you're grouping properly. Note, some fields may be null or have only one value.
    When answering questions about a specific field, ensure you are selecting the identifying column (ie. what is Vercel's valuation would select company and valuation').


    Note: valuation is in billions of dollars so 10b would be 10.0.
    Note: if the user asks for a rate, return it as a decimal. For example, 0.1 would be 10%.

    If the user asks for 'over time' data, return by year.

    EVERY QUERY SHOULD RETURN QUANTITATIVE DATA THAT CAN BE PLOTTED ON A CHART! There should always be at least two columns. If the user asks for a single column, return the column and the count of the column. If the user asks for a rate, return the rate as a decimal. For example, 0.1 would be 10%.
